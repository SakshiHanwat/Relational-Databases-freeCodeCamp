# Useful Keyboard Shortcuts for Maximizing Productivity in VS Code

## Introduction

Keyboard shortcuts are one of the best ways to work faster and more efficiently in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. Many common shortcuts come from your operating system, but VS Code also provides several **application-specific shortcuts** that can greatly improve your productivity. This document explains the most useful shortcuts in simple English for learning and revision.

## Basic Common Shortcuts

Some shortcuts are already familiar and work the same in VS Code:

* **Ctrl + S** – Save the current file
* **Ctrl + C** – Copy selected text
* **Ctrl + V** – Paste copied text

These shortcuts are inherited from the operating system and are used frequently.

---

## Formatting Code

* **Shift + Alt + F** (Windows/Linux)

This shortcut runs the **configured formatter** on the currently opened file. For example, in JavaScript projects, it may use **Prettier** to format the code automatically.

---

## Searching and Replacing in Workspace

* **Ctrl + Shift + F** (Windows) / **Cmd + Shift + F** (Mac)

  * Searches text across **all files in the workspace**.

* **Ctrl + Shift + H** (Windows) / **Cmd + Shift + H** (Mac)

  * Performs **find and replace** across all files.

These shortcuts are very useful when working on large projects.

## Deleting a Line

* **Ctrl + Shift + K** (Windows/Linux) / **Cmd + Shift + K** (Mac)

This shortcut deletes the **entire current line** instantly without needing to select it.

---

## Managing Screen Space

* **Ctrl + B** (Windows) / **Cmd + B** (Mac)

  * Toggles (shows/hides) the **sidebar**, which contains the file explorer and extensions.

This is useful when you need more space to focus on your code.

---

## Zooming In and Out

* **Ctrl + Plus (+)** (Windows) / **Cmd + Plus (+)** (Mac)

  * Increases the editor zoom level.

* **Ctrl + Minus (-)** (Windows) / **Cmd + Minus (-)** (Mac)

  * Decreases the editor zoom level.

These shortcuts help when the code text feels too small or too large.

## Multi-Line Editing (Multiple Cursors)

VS Code supports **multi-line editing**, allowing you to edit multiple lines at the same time.

### Add Cursors on Consecutive Lines

* **Ctrl + Alt + Down / Up** (Windows/Linux)
* **Option + Command + Down / Up** (Mac)

This extends the cursor to the next or previous line.

### Add Cursors Manually

* Hold **Alt** (Windows/Linux) or **Option** (Mac) and click anywhere in the editor.

Once multiple cursors are placed, anything you type or delete happens in **all cursor locations simultaneously**, which is extremely useful for repetitive code.

---

## Command Palette

* **Ctrl + Shift + P** (Windows/Linux)
* **Cmd + Shift + P** (Mac)

This opens the **Command Palette**, where you can search and run almost any VS Code command. It is very helpful if you forget a shortcut.

## Conclusion

By learning and practicing these keyboard shortcuts, you can work faster, write cleaner code, and become more confident using VS Code. With time, these shortcuts will feel natural and help you become a **VS Code power user**.
