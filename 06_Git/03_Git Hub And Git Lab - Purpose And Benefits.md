# What Is the Purpose of Sites Like GitHub and GitLab, and What Are Some Benefits of Using Them?

## Introduction

In earlier lessons, we learned about Git as a version control system. GitHub and GitLab take Git one step further. They are **version control providers**, which means they offer **cloud-based platforms** where Git projects can be stored, shared, and managed easily.

These platforms help developers collaborate better, manage projects efficiently, and maintain a clean workflow.

## What Are GitHub and GitLab?

GitHub and GitLab are online services that:

* Store Git projects in the cloud
* Organize projects into **repositories**
* Provide collaboration and project management tools

A **repository** is a place where all project files, commit history, and branches are stored together.

## Types of Projects: Open-Source vs Closed-Source

### Open-Source Projects

Open-source projects are those where:

* Anyone can view the code
* People can suggest changes
* Users can report bugs or issues
* Others can create and run modified versions of the project

These projects encourage community collaboration and learning.

### Closed-Source Projects

Closed-source projects are private. This means:

* Only authorized people can view the code
* Access is limited to team members
* The public cannot see or interact with the project

This is commonly used for company projects or private team work.

## Why GitHub and GitLab Are Important

Whether a project is open-source or closed-source, GitHub and GitLab significantly improve collaboration.

They allow teams to:

* Share work easily
* Review changes properly
* Keep everyone updated with the latest code

---

## Collaboration and Code Review

When a team member is working on a feature and needs help, they can:

* Upload their changes to GitHub or GitLab
* Let others view the code directly in a browser
* Allow teammates to download and test the code locally

There is no need to copy-paste code into chat apps or do constant screen sharing.

---

## Proposing and Reviewing Changes

Once a feature is complete, a developer can **propose changes** using pull requests or merge requests.

Team members can then:

* Review the code online
* Leave comments on specific lines or files
* Suggest edits directly in the browser

If everything looks good, the changes can be **merged into the primary branch**, making them available to the entire team.

---

## Keeping the Team in Sync

After changes are merged:

* All team members can pull the latest version
* Everyone works with the most up-to-date code
* Future tasks start from a consistent codebase

This avoids confusion and version mismatch issues.

---

## Project Management Features

GitHub and GitLab also provide tools beyond code storage, such as:

* **Issue trackers** for bugs, tasks, and feature requests
* **Project boards** to plan work and manage sprints
* Task assignment and progress tracking

These features help teams plan, organize, and execute work efficiently.

---

## Summary

GitHub and GitLab are powerful platforms that combine Git version control with cloud storage, collaboration, code review, and project management tools. They make teamwork smoother, improve code quality, and help manage both open-source and closed-source projects effectively.
